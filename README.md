# Gneiss Rocks

## Great pun, but what is it for?
My background is in Geology/Geophysics. I have lurked around many a corner hoping that someone would bring up the subject of rocks, so that I might burst into action much like Tony Wonder does in Arrested Development. Never has such a case happened. Instead, I do my best to inform a curious mind about the rock formations around us.

Sadly, it is not always the case for one to have the friendly neightborhood geologist to turn to for information. For the untrained eye, it is difficult to recognize and identify rocks in the field. I wanted to make a rock identifier app so that the average student, rock enthusiast, or nature lover could learn more about our Earth's history.
