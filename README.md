# Gneiss Rocks

## Great pun, but what is it for?
My background is in Geology/Geophysics. I have lurked around many a corner hoping that someone would bring up the subject of rocks, so that I might burst into action much like Tony Wonder does in Arrested Development. Never has such a case happened. Instead, I do my best to inform a curious mind about the rock formations around us.

Sadly, it is not always the case for one to have the friendly neightborhood geologist to turn to for information. For the untrained eye, it is difficult to recognize and identify rocks in the field. I wanted to make a rock identifier app so that the average student, rock enthusiast, or nature lover could learn more about our Earth's history.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need quite a few things installed on your environment to get going.

-Rails 5.1.3

-Ruby 2.4.1

-Python 2.7x

-Google SDK

The [docs](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) for Google Cloud SDK are pretty comprehensive and I suggest you start there for getting everything set up on your machine.

Things you may want to cover:


## Install

$ git clone git@github.com:sarahdactyl71/gneiss-rocks.git
$ cd gneiss-rocks
$ bundle install

Please note this is assuming everything was installed and set up properly with Google SDK.

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
